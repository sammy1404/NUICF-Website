    <p>NUICF is a locally based Christian fellowship founded on the principles of the New Testament. 
        We are a non-denominational, multicultural fellowship patterned after the practices of the Early Churches, 
        as described in Acts 2:42. Our journey began in August 2008, with a few families gathering in a house to pray each month. 
        By the Grace of God, what started as family gathering has now continued to grow as a fellowship united in Christ.
    </p>


    <p>We gather to worship twice a month, once for our fellowship meeting on the last saturday of every month, 
        and again for our mid-month prayer drive, tracts distribution, and Bible study. By the grace of God, 
        our worship team has continually grown, and our community engagement has flourished. At our Christmas celebration 
        in 2017, nearly 200 people from the local community gathered to worship the Lord.
    </p>

    <p>Our fellowship places great importance on nurturing children in the faith. During our fellowship meetings, 
        children have their saturday class led by our wonderful sisters in Christ. They are also given opportunities to actively 
        participate during Bible study sessions. This has fostered a sense of involvement and growth among the younger members 
        of our community.

    <p>
        We warmly welcome you to come and worship with us.
