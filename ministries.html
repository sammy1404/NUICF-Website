            <h2>Saturday Fellowship</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Our regular worship meeting is held on the last Saturday of the month at 6 pm. During this time, we come together to worship, share testimonies, and grow in our faith.</p>
                <p>We also meet for a prayer drive and tract distribution on the second Saturday of each month at 5 pm. This is followed by a Bible study session starting at 7 pm, where we delve into the Word of God and engage in meaningful discussions.</p>
                <p>Special meetings are organized several times a year, with extended invitations to the local community. These gatherings include celebrations of significant occasions such as Easter and Christmas. We also hold a special service on the 31st of December, known as the watch night service, to welcome the New Year in prayer and worship.</p>
                <p>After every meeting, we share a meal together, featuring delicious Indian food, fostering fellowship and community spirit.</p>
