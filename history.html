                NUICF is a Christian Fellowship based on the principles of the New Testament. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is a non-denominational, multicultural fellowship patterned after the practices of the 
                Early Churches (Acts 2:42).
            </p>

            <p>
                In August 2008, NUICF started off as a family gathering only for special occasions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                by Grace of God we are continuing to grow as a fellowship United in Christ meeting at least twice a month. 
            </p>

            
            <p>
                Through the years, God has blessed NUICF with amazing families who share the love of God in their words and their works.
